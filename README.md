# Consecutive-Shift-Cipher-Solver-Selenium-Based

This was from a competition where 50 shift ciphers needed to be solved correctly within a few seconds, provided on and entered into a website form. 


To accomplish, frequency analysis is used to determine the most likely mappings. From there, the first few words from the possible solution are checked using NLTK to see if they are actually words. If they are words, cipher solved! (Then solution is entered)
